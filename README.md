# üöÄ Professional Portfolio Website

Welcome to `portfolio-light-blue`, my personal portfolio website designed to showcase my capabilities and projects as a full-stack developer. With a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence, gaming, and emerging technologies, this platform is crafted to reflect my expertise and dedication to the field. The chosen light blue aesthetic provides a clean, modern, and visually appealing interface.

This project leverages contemporary web development tools to ensure a robust, efficient, and user-friendly experience. It incorporates both light and dark mode functionalities, prioritizing user comfort and accessibility.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Modern and Intuitive Design:** Features a clean layout and a light blue theme, optimized for visual clarity and user engagement.

* **Dynamic Theme Switching:** Includes a toggle for seamless transition between light and dark modes, enhancing user preference and reducing eye strain.

* **Fully Responsive Layout:** Engineered to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, including desktops, 2-in-1 laptops (such as the Dell Inspiron 7573), and mobile devices, ensuring no horizontal scrolling.

* **Advanced Technology Stack:** Developed using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, resulting in a high-performance, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

* **Integrated shadcn/ui Components:** Utilizes a library of pre-built, accessible, and highly customizable UI components to accelerate development and ensure consistency.

* **TypeScript Implementation:** Employs TypeScript for enhanced code quality, type safety, and early detection of potential errors, contributing to a more reliable application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built upon a robust selection of modern web development technologies:

* [**React**](https://react.dev/): A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/): A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an exceptionally fast development server and optimized build processes.

* [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code predictability and maintainability.

* [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid styling and consistent design application.

* [**shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/): A collection of reusable UI components built on Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS, emphasizing accessibility and customization.

* [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/): A static code analysis tool used to identify problematic patterns found in JavaScript and TypeScript code, ensuring code quality and consistency.

* [**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/): A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, used for various CSS processing tasks.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development Setup)

To set up and run this project on your local machine, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and a package manager (npm, Yarn, or pnpm) installed on your system. For users on Ubuntu 25.04, these tools are commonly pre-installed or easily installable.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyanMaxiemus/portfolio-light-blue.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd portfolio-light-blue
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
It is imperative to install all project dependencies before proceeding with the build process.

```bash
npm install # Or yarn install, or pnpm install, based on your preferred package manager
```

### Running the Development Server

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev # Or yarn dev, or pnpm dev
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. Vite's development server offers hot module replacement for an efficient development workflow.

## üì¶ Building for Production

To generate a production-ready build of the application, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build # Or yarn build, or pnpm build
```

This command will compile and optimize all source code, assets, and dependencies into a `dist` folder. The contents of this `dist` folder are suitable for deployment to a web server.

## üëã Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you identify any bugs, have feature suggestions, or propose improvements, please consider the following:

* Submit an issue to report bugs or propose new features.

* Fork the repository and create a pull request with your modifications.

I am committed to continuous improvement and actively seek opportunities to integrate new advancements, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence, into my development practices.
